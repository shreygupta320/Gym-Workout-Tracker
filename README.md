# My Fitness Tracker App

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my Fitness Tracker App. I'm excited to share this project with you!

## What's This All About?

I created this app because I wanted a simple way to keep track of my workouts and see how I'm progressing over time. It's a passion project that combines my love for coding and fitness.

## Features

Here's what you can do with my app:

- 🔐 Create your own secure account
- 💪 Log your workouts easily
- 🔥 See how many calories you've burned
- 📊 View cool charts of your progress
- 🕰️ Look back at your workout history

## How It Works

I've built this app using some neat technologies:

- Frontend: React (because I love how it makes UIs interactive)
- Backend: Node.js with Express (it's fast and fun to work with)
- Database: MongoDB (for flexible data storage)

The app uses JWT for secure authentication, so you can trust that your fitness data is safe with me!

## Getting Started

Want to try it out? Here's how:

1. Clone this repo to your local machine
2. Run `npm install` in both the frontend and backend directories
3. Set up your MongoDB database and add the connection string to a `.env` file
4. Run `npm start` in both directories
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

## How to Use

Using the app is super easy:

1. Sign up for an account
2. Start adding your workouts
3. Check out your dashboard to see your progress

The format for adding workouts is simple:

## What's Next?

I'm always looking to improve this app. Some things I'm thinking about:

- Adding social features so you can compete with friends
- Integrating with fitness wearables for automatic tracking
- Creating a mobile app version
